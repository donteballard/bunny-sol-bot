# Project Requirements Document: Solana Trading Bot  

## Project Overview  
The **Solana Trading Bot** is designed to automate trading activities for altcoins and meme coins built on the Solana blockchain. The bot will perform tasks such as buying new tokens from liquidity pools, executing trades based on pre-configured conditions, and managing token holdings. The goal is to enable seamless, automated trading with advanced filters and timers to optimize profits and minimize risks.

## Functional Requirements  

### 1. **Buy New Tokens in the Pool**  
- **Objective**: Automatically detect and purchase new tokens as they are added to a Solana liquidity pool.  
- **Features**:  
  - Integrate with Solana DEXs (e.g., Serum, Raydium).  
  - Automatically identify tokens with newly established liquidity.  
  - Set configurable purchase parameters such as:  
    - Initial buy amount.  
    - Slippage tolerance.  
    - Maximum transaction fee limit.

### 2. **Automated Buying and Selling**  
- **Objective**: Automate the process of buying and selling tokens based on pre-defined criteria.  
- **Features**:  
  - **Buy Orders**:  
    - Execute buy orders when tokens meet conditions such as:  
      - Volume thresholds.  
      - Price trends (e.g., bullish movement).  
  - **Sell Orders**:  
    - Automatically sell tokens based on:  
      - Profit percentage (e.g., sell when 20% profit is achieved).  
      - Loss percentage (e.g., stop-loss at 10% loss).  
  - Support for market orders and limit orders.  

---

### 3. **Profit & Loss Filters**  
- **Objective**: Minimize risks and secure profits by configuring profit and loss thresholds.  
- **Features**:  
  - **Profit Filters**:  
    - Define a profit percentage for selling tokens (e.g., sell when profit exceeds 25%).  
  - **Loss Filters**:  
    - Configure stop-loss thresholds to minimize losses (e.g., sell when loss exceeds 15%).  
  - Real-time tracking of token value to ensure timely action.  
  - Generate notifications/logs for triggered buy/sell actions.  

---

### 4. **Holding Timer with Buy/Sell Options**  
- **Objective**: Manage token holdings with a timer-based approach, enabling strategic decision-making.  
- **Features**:  
  - Configure holding duration for tokens (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours).  
  - Automatically sell tokens after the holding period if conditions are met:  
    - Price drop below a threshold.  
    - No significant price movement.  
  - Provide options to:  
    - Buy more of the token if it shows promise during the holding period.  
    - Sell all holdings at the end of the timer.  
  - Generate alerts before the holding period ends for manual intervention if required.

## Non-Functional Requirements  

### 1. **Performance**  
- Ensure the bot executes trades within milliseconds of detecting conditions.  
- Maintain minimal latency by hosting the bot on a high-performance server or edge-computing environment close to Solana validators.  

### 2. **Scalability**  
- Support trading multiple tokens simultaneously.  
- Handle increasing token pools and trade volumes efficiently.  

### 3. **Security**  
- Encrypt private keys and API credentials securely.  
- Utilize a secure connection to interact with Solana RPC nodes and DEX APIs.  
- Implement two-factor authentication for accessing the botâ€™s dashboard.  

### 4. **Reliability**  
- Ensure the bot runs 24/7 with automatic recovery mechanisms for unexpected failures.  
- Maintain accurate tracking of token prices and order statuses.  

---

## User Interface Requirements  

### 1. **Dashboard**  
- Display real-time portfolio overview:  
  - Token balances.  
  - Open orders.  
  - Profit/loss tracking.  
- Provide controls for configuring filters, holding timers, and trade parameters.  

### 2. **Trade Logs**  
- Record and display:  
  - All executed trades with timestamps.  
  - Profit/loss calculations for each trade.  
  - Error logs (e.g., failed transactions).  

### 3. **Notification System**  
- Notify users via email or app alerts for:  
  - Triggered buy/sell actions.  
  - Holding timer expirations.  
  - Significant price movements for held tokens.  

---

## Technology Stack  

### 1. **Blockchain Interaction**  
- Solana RPC nodes for blockchain interaction.  
- Solana SDK for programmatic trading.  

### 2. **Backend**  
- Node.js or Python for core bot logic.  
- Integration with Solana DEX APIs.  

### 3. **Frontend**  
- React or Vue.js for the user interface.  

### 4. **Database**  
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing trade logs, configuration settings, and portfolio data.  

### 5. **Hosting**  
- Deploy on AWS, GCP, or another cloud provider to ensure high availability and performance.
