# Detailed App Flow Document: Solana Trading Bot  

## Overview  
This document outlines the end-to-end flow of the Solana Trading Bot, detailing how users interact with the application, how the bot executes trades, and how the system manages and processes data. The app flow ensures efficient automated trading, adherence to user configurations, and timely notifications.  

---

## Key Modules  

1. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - Provides user-friendly access to configure bot settings and view trading performance.  

2. **Trading Engine**  
   - Core logic that interacts with the Solana blockchain to execute trades based on predefined rules.  

3. **Price Monitoring Service**  
   - Monitors token prices in real-time and triggers trading actions when conditions are met.  

4. **Notification Service**  
   - Sends alerts to users about trading actions and performance metrics.  

5. **Data Storage**  
   - Manages persistent storage of configurations, trade logs, and performance metrics.  

6. **API Integration**  
   - Connects to Solana RPC nodes and token pool APIs for price and liquidity data.

## App Flow  

### 1. **User Setup**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. User registers or logs in via the UI.  
2. User sets up or updates their trading preferences:  
   - Profit/loss thresholds.  
   - Holding timer.  
   - Slippage tolerance.  
3. User selects tokens to monitor or trade.  
4. Preferences are saved in the **User Settings** table.  

**Outcome**:  
- User configurations are ready, and the bot begins monitoring the selected tokens.  

---

### 2. **Token Monitoring**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. The **Price Monitoring Service** fetches real-time price data from Solana pools using RPC or token APIs.  
2. The service updates the **Tokens** table with the latest prices.  
3. The bot evaluates the prices against the user's configured thresholds.  

**Conditions Checked**:  
- Does the price meet the profit or loss threshold for a trade?  
- Is the token held beyond the configured timer?  

**Outcome**:  
- If conditions are met, the bot triggers the trading process.  

---

### 3. **Trading Execution**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. **Buy Operation**:  
   - For new tokens:  
     - The bot identifies new token pools on Solana with sufficient liquidity.  
     - Executes a buy transaction using the configured slippage tolerance.  
     - Logs the transaction in the **Trades** table.  

2. **Sell Operation**:  
   - For monitored tokens:  
     - The bot evaluates price changes against the user's profit/loss thresholds.  
     - If thresholds are met or the holding timer expires:  
       - Executes a sell transaction.  
       - Logs the transaction in the **Trades** table.  

**Outcome**:  
- Trades are executed, and logs are updated for further analysis.  

---

### 4. **Data Logging and Metrics**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. After each trade, the **Trading Engine** updates:  
   - Trade logs in the **Trades** table.  
   - Performance metrics in the **Performance Metrics** table.  
2. Metrics include:  
   - Total trades.  
   - Profit/loss ratio.  
   - Successful vs. failed trades.  

**Outcome**:  
- The app maintains a comprehensive record of all trading activities and performance.  

---

### 5. **Notification System**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. Based on trading events, the **Notification Service** checks user preferences for alerts.  
2. Notifications are generated for:  
   - Successful trades.  
   - Threshold breaches.  
   - Errors or failures in trade execution.  
3. Notifications are sent via email, SMS, or app notifications.  

**Outcome**:  
- Users are kept informed of bot activities and performance.  

---

### 6. **Error Handling**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. If a trade fails (e.g., due to insufficient liquidity or slippage):  
   - The bot retries the transaction up to a configurable limit.  
2. Errors are logged in an **Error Log** table.  
3. Users are notified if critical errors persist.  

**Outcome**:  
- The bot maintains reliability and communicates issues effectively.  

---

### 7. **User Reporting and Analytics**  
**Flow Steps**:  
1. Users can view detailed reports via the UI, including:  
   - Trade history.  
   - Performance metrics.  
   - Notifications.  
2. Reports are generated by querying the **Trades** and **Performance Metrics** tables.  

**Outcome**:  
- Users gain insights into their trading strategies and bot performance.

## Additional Scenarios  

### A. **New Token Detection**  
- The bot periodically scans Solana token pools for new liquidity pairs.  
- If a new token meets the userâ€™s criteria (e.g., low price, high liquidity):  
  - It is added to the **Tokens** table.  
  - A buy trade is initiated.  

### B. **User Adjusts Settings Mid-Operation**  
- Updated settings are fetched and applied immediately to ongoing monitoring.  
- Pending trades are adjusted to reflect new thresholds.  

### C. **System Failure or Downtime**  
- The bot uses a retry mechanism for critical operations.  
- State is restored from the database upon reboot.

## Performance Considerations  

- **Real-Time Price Updates**: Use efficient polling or WebSocket connections for minimal latency.  
- **Scalable Design**: The architecture supports monitoring and trading multiple tokens concurrently.  
- **Error Resilience**: Implement robust error handling and retries to ensure reliability.
